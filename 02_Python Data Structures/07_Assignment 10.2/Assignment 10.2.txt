Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
#From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
time = list()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From '):
        continue
    line = line.rstrip()
    wrds = line.split()
    hour = wrds[5]
    hour = hour.split(':')
    hour = hour[0]
    time.append(hour)

for x in time:
    counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1
x = sorted(counts.items())
 

for a,b in sorted(counts.items()):
    print(a,b)
